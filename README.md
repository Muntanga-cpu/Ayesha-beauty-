The following project is a salon application that helps create efficiency in the human resource function, creates customer relationship management to serve as a sales too and creates value for the business measured in financial returns in products/service ,it includes the modules, functions and the names of contributers. 
under the modules we have a customer profile, that allows customers to have a free account on the app, this feature will help monitoring the customers activities and it will help us see which products and services they look at the most, this feature also takes in the customer details which will make it easier to communicate with them.Another module that we have is the products module that shows all the hair, skin and nail products offered at the salon, this gives easy access to them as they do not need to come to the salon when they are in need of these products but inswtead they can just purchase them online and we can deliver them to their doorsteps using our delivery system.Another module that we have is the appointment module, this is a booking system that allows customers to make appointments stating the date and time they want to have their services done.
